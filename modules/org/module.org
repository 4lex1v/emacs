* Org Mode configuration
  
** Org Mode support

Just not to forget. My Foundation framework i'm using for my Emacs configuration relies on the Org-Mode
to process "module.org" files, it's some sort of chicken-and-egg problem. To solve it i've added [[file:~/.emacs.d/init.el::(add-to-list%20'load-path%20(expand-file-name%20"modules/org/org-mode/lisp"%20user-emacs-directory))][a line]] 
to my configuration which bootstraps Foundation with a proper Org-Mode installation (i've also removed 
original "org" folder from the distribution itself).

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results none
  (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "modules/org/org-mode/lisp" user-emacs-directory))
#+END_SRC

A bunch of standard settings for a customized Org-Mode experience:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results none
  (setq org-log-done             t
        org-src-fontify-natively t
        org-descriptive-links    t
        org-startup-with-inline-images t
        org-babel-load-languages '((emacs-lisp . t)
                                   (scala      . t)
                                   (haskell    . t)
                                   (shell      . t)))

  (with-mode which-key
    (which-key-declare-prefixes
      "C-c o" "org"))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results none
  (use-package org
    :after flyspell
    :bind
    (("C-c o l" . org-store-link)
     ("C-c o a" . org-agenda)
     ("C-c o c" . org-capture))
    :bind* ("C-'"  . ace-window)) ;; I believe doesn't make much sense with Evil? 
#+END_SRC

Still struggling to choose a consistent way of doing this:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results none
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'flyspell-mode)
#+END_SRC


A bunch of nice configurations i saw in [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DSzA2YODtgK4]["Getting started with Org Mode" by Harry Schwartz]]:
   
- This one replaces Org's =...= with downwards arrow:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-ellipsis "â¬Ž")
#+END_SRC 
   
- This one removes leading =*=, though it breaks some "perception", so I'm not using it
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-hide-leading-stars nil)
#+END_SRC
