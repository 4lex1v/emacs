* Conventions
** Mnemonic Bindings
To improve the efficiency in working with Emacs in conjunction with the Evil mode, this configuration tries its best to maintain mnemonic key-chords under certain keys, like =G= to work with =Git= (via Magit), =E= for Emacs, =M= for Mode-specific settings, etc...
** Upper-case (Shift) keystrokes for alternative form
For convenience, some bindings follow the convention to use a an upper-case (=Shift=) key for command that provide some alternative, like a set of command to show the execution in =-other-window=
** Commands quick access
Some modules provide a "quick access" menu under the =,= key
